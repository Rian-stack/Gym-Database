## Overview
This project implements a simple member management system in Java, featuring functionalities to add, find, and manage gym member information. The system uses a database-like structure to store member details and provides sorting capabilities.

## Files
- **Database-1.java**: This class manages the member information, including methods for adding new members, finding existing members, and sorting them by last name using quicksort.
  
- **Main-4.java**: This is the main class of the application, responsible for interacting with the user. It handles input and output, allowing users to add members and view the member list.

- **Member-1.java**: This class encapsulates the member data, including attributes like name, ID, and other relevant information. It serves as a blueprint for creating member objects.

- **README.md**: This file, which provides documentation for the project.

## Features
- **Add Members**: Users can add new members to the database.
- **Find Members**: The system allows users to search for members by their attributes.
- **Sort Members**: Members can be sorted by their last names using a quicksort algorithm.
- **Display Members**: Users can view the list of all members in a formatted manner.

## Usage
1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac Database-1.java Main-4.java Member-1.java`).
2. Run the main application with the command: `java Main-4`.
3. Follow the prompts to add and manage member information.

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
